<div>macOS has a feature that ignores the Caps Lock key if it is pressed only briefly to prevent accidental keystrokes.</div>
<div>This setting removes that behavior, ensuring that the Caps Lock key is always recognized.</div>
<div>In practice, this is achieved by making the Caps Lock key appear as if it is pressed for at least 100 milliseconds, so that it is always processed by macOS.</div>
