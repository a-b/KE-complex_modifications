  macOS has a feature that ignores the Caps Lock key if it is pressed only briefly to prevent accidental keystrokes. This setting removes that behavior, ensuring that the Caps Lock key is always
  recognized.

<p>In practice, this is achieved by making the Caps Lock key appear as if it is pressed for at least 100 milliseconds, so that it is always processed by macOS.</p>
