<p class="lead" style="margin-top: 20px;">
   A carefully-designed, alternative, programming-oriented number-row, for those of us who use the symbols far more often than the numbers.
</p>

<p>
   <span style="font-weight: bold">NOTE: These (with the exception of the &lsquo;lite&rsquo;, unshifting-only mode) have no effect unless &lsquo;Colemak&rsquo; is selected in macOS's input-method configuration.</span> This intentionally gives you a quick escape-hatch when others use your laptop &mdash; enable &lsquo;input source in menu bar&rsquo;, and then just click it and select your original layout if someone else is going to be using your computer!

   This is my (<a href="https://twitter.com/ELLIOTTCABLE">@ELLIOTTCABLE</a>&rsquo;s) keyboard-layout project. I'd like to give this layout an actual homepage, once it stabilizes, with more info; but here's a summary for now:
</p>

<ol>
   <li>Start with <a href="https://colemak.com/">Colemak</a>&sup1; (Probably <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/">Mod-DH</a>&sup2;);</li>
   <li>Re-arrange the number keys into a more useful, logical order &mdash; like <a href="https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/">Programmer&rsquo;s Dvorak</a>;</li>
   <li>Swap the shifting &mdash; bring the symbols down to the default position, and require that the Shift key be pressed to access the original numbers;</li>
   <li><strong>NYI</strong>: further re-arrange the now-unshifted symbols to optimize for common operations amongst programmers.&sup3;</li>
</ol>

<p>
   The current revision of this layout doesn't attempt that last one &mdash; each symbol is moved precisely alongside its corresponding number. (This is already an excellent improvement, in my experience &mdash; <tt>!</tt> and <tt>@</tt> being on the index fingers is absolutely excellent for DuckDuckGo and Twitter! &#x1F609; Not to mention that this approach is very keycap-compatible, for those of us with external, mechanical keyboards.)
</p>

<p>
  (There's also a second, &lsquo;lite&rsquo; mode that only unshifts the symbol-row. This is useful if you can programmatically or physically remap the layout of keys your physical keyboard, but cannot programmatically swap the shift-modifier behaviour. This version is <em>not</em> restricted to the OS-level Colemak mapping, because it's assumed you can remap your alphas in the same fashion as you remapped your number-row, and are thus not using the OS-level remapping.)
</p>

<p>
   I suggest using this alongside these other modifications:
</p>

<ul>
   <li><strong>Modern Space Cadet (rev 3)</strong> &mdash; <code>Caps Lock to Escape on single press, Control on press and hold.</code></li>
   <li><strong>Mouse Keys Mode v4 (rev 1)</strong></li>
</ul>

  Notes:
</p>

<ol>
   <li>Why Colemak? This argument has gone 'round and 'round a million times, but my personal reasons are pretty simple: Proven, available built-in to every major OS that I might need to pair-program on, easy to learn for normies I may evangelize to, and there's at <em>least</em> a snowball's chance in hell that I'll be able to find sculpted, beautiful keycaps that actually match what th damn keys do.</li>
   <li>&mldr; unless you're like me, use an external keyboard, and would like to use sculpted keycaps that match your actual layout. See footnote 1.</li>
   <li>I have lots of plans in this direction (at the very least, Space-Cadet-Shift or not, the parentheses belong on either the index or middle fingers!); but I want to go about them in a systematic way. I've got a few databases I'd like to scrape for symbol-frequency numbers &mdash; GitHub for various programming-language figures, <a href="https://twitter.com/ELLIOTTCABLE/status/994665038664421380">VimGolf</a> for The One True Editor's controls, etceteras &mdash; as well as reaching out for feedback from specific communities â€” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/mk</a>, <a href="https://deskthority.net/">Deskthority</a>, the <a href="https://forum.colemak.com/">Colemak forums</a> &mldr;. Anyway. I'm sure I'll get to it someday. Suuuuure. <tt>:P</tt></li>
