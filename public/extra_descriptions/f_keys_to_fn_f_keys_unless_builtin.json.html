<h4>Description</h4>
<h5>Send Fn + Function keys for external keyboards.</h5>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>From v15.2.0 of Karabiner Element the F1-F12 key events sent by Karabiner-Elements, macOS will convert them once again into media keys (e.g., sending F10 will trigger mute).
    <br/> If you want to send F1-F12 as-is using Complex Modifications, you will need to send fn+F1-F12 through Karabiner-Elements.
    <br/> This rule will send the F1-F12 keys as if you were pressing the fn key on an external keyboard.
